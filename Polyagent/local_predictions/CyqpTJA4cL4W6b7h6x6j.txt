Market: Will any AI score ≥85% on ARC-AGI-2 by November 3?
Prediction: NO @ $0.805

=== ANÁLISIS DE NOTICIAS ===
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know the probability that any AI will score ≥85% on ARC-AGI-2 by November 3, 2025. The current market prices are YES: 0.195 and NO: 0.805, so the implied probability is about 19.5% for YES. But I need to estimate the real probability based on available information.

First, I need to look at the recent news and data. From the search results, the latest info is from May 1, 2025, where OpenAI's o3 model scored 3% on ARC-AGI-2. That's really low. The human average is 60%, so there's a huge gap. The ARC Prize 2025 is ongoing, with a deadline in November. The competition requires models to spend no more than $0.42 per task and can't use the internet. The grand prize is $700k, which might incentivize participation, but the current scores are way below 85%.

Key factors to consider: the difficulty of ARC-AGI-2, current model performance, time remaining until November, computational and financial constraints, and the nature of the tasks. The benchmark is designed to resist memorization, requiring fluid intelligence. Current models are struggling, even high-compute versions are timing out. The time left is about 6 months, which might not be enough for a breakthrough. Also, the cost constraint of $0.42 per task limits the computational resources teams can use, making it harder to achieve high scores.

In the detailed analysis, the current scores are around 3%, which is far from 85%. The tasks are calibrated to be similar, so even if some tasks are easier, the overall score needs to be high. The competition's structure might encourage innovation, but the gap is massive. The time frame is short for such a significant improvement. Also, the private evaluation set is unknown, so even if models do well on public tasks, the private ones might be tougher.

Probability estimation: Given the current scores and the time left, it's unlikely that any team can jump from 3% to 85% in six months. The market's implied probability is 19.5%, but considering the technical challenges and the lack of progress so far, the real probability might be lower. Maybe around 5-10%, but I need to check if there's any indication of rapid progress. The search results don't mention any models close to 85%, so I'll lean towards a lower probability. Let's say 5% as a conservative estimate.

=== NEWS ANALYSIS ===  
Recent developments indicate significant challenges for AI systems on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark:  
- **OpenAI's o3 (Medium)** currently scores **3.0%** on ARC-AGI-2, with high-compute versions failing to respond or timing out on most tasks[3].  
- **Human performance** averages **60%**, demonstrating the benchmark's design to test fluid intelligence rather than memorization[3][5].  
- The **ARC Prize 2025** competition (deadline November 3, 2025) requires models to achieve **85% accuracy** on the private evaluation set while spending ≤$0.42 per task and operating offline[5].  

=== KEY FACTORS ===  
1. **Current Performance Gaps**: Existing models (e.g., o3) score <3%, far below the 85% threshold[3].  
2. **Benchmark Difficulty**: ARC-AGI-2 tasks require reasoning, not memorization, with calibrated datasets to ensure consistency[2][5].  
3. **Time Constraints**: Only ~6 months remain until the November 3 deadline, limiting opportunities for breakthroughs.  
4. **Resource Limits**: The $0.42/task budget restricts computational intensity, favoring efficient algorithms over brute-force approaches[5].  
5. **Private Evaluation Uncertainty**: The private test set’s difficulty is unknown, potentially exceeding public benchmarks[5].  

=== DETAILED ANALYSIS ===  
The ARC-AGI-2 benchmark is explicitly designed to resist memorization and test fluid intelligence, requiring models to generalize across novel tasks[2][5]. Current state-of-the-art models like o3 demonstrate minimal progress, with scores orders of magnitude below human performance[3]. While the competition’s $700k prize incentivizes participation, the 85% target represents a **28x improvement** over o3’s current score—a leap unprecedented in recent AI benchmark history.  

The time frame (6 months) is insufficient for developing fundamentally new architectures capable of such a jump, especially under strict computational and financial constraints. Additionally, the private evaluation set’s calibration ensures that public task performance does not guarantee success on hidden tasks[5].  

=== PROBABILITY ESTIMATION ===  
The estimated probability for the 'YES' outcome is: **0.05** (5%)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical Hurdles**: The gap between current AI performance (3%) and the target (85%) is extreme, with no evidence of near-term breakthroughs.  
- **Resource Constraints**: The $0.42/task limit precludes expensive training or inference strategies, limiting model scalability.  
- **Historical Precedent**: No AI system has achieved comparable jumps on similarly challenging benchmarks within such short timeframes.  
- **Market Sentiment**: The current implied probability (19.5%) overestimates the likelihood, as it does not fully account for the benchmark’s design to resist rapid progress[2][3][5].
