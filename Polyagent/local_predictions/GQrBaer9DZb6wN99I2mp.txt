Market: Will any AI score ≥85% on ARC-AGI-2 by November 3?
Prediction: NO @ $0.77

=== ANÁLISIS DE NOTICIAS ===
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to know the probability that any AI will score ≥85% on ARC-AGI-2 by November 3, 2025. The current market prices are YES: 0.23 and NO: 0.77, so the implied probability is 23% for YES. But I need to figure out the real probability based on the provided search results.

First, I'll look at the recent news. The search results mention that OpenAI's o3 model scored 2.9% on ARC-AGI-2, and the high-compute versions failed or timed out. The human average is 60%, and each task was solved by at least two humans in two attempts. The competition is ongoing until November 3, 2025, and the Grand Prize requires 85% accuracy on the private evaluation set. The leaderboard currently shows partial results, with the final 50% of test data not yet used.

Key factors here are the current performance of top models, the difficulty of the benchmark, the time remaining until November 3, and the competition's structure. The ARC-AGI-2 is designed to be harder than its predecessor, requiring fluid intelligence. The fact that even the best models are scoring around 3% suggests a huge gap. However, the competition is still open, and participants might improve their approaches.

The analysis should consider that while the current scores are very low, there's time left for teams to develop better strategies. But given the benchmark's design to resist memorization and require reasoning, significant progress might be challenging. The high-compute models failing indicates that brute force isn't effective here. The human performance is much higher, but AI systems need to demonstrate similar reasoning abilities, which they haven't yet.

Estimating the probability: The current scores are way below 85%, and the competition's difficulty is high. However, the competition is ongoing, and participants might find innovative solutions. But given the time left (about 6 months from May to November) and the complexity of the tasks, it's unlikely that any team can reach 85%. The market's current NO probability of 77% seems reasonable, but maybe a bit low. Considering the time and possible breakthroughs, maybe the real probability is around 10-15%, but given the current state, even lower. However, the user wants a precise number. The search results don't indicate any recent breakthroughs, so the probability is likely lower than the market's 23%. Maybe around 5-10%? But I need to balance between the time left and the difficulty. Since the competition is on Kaggle and participants are active, but the benchmark is tough, I'll estimate 10% as a cautious guess.

=== NEWS ANALYSIS ===  
Recent updates indicate OpenAI's o3 model achieved **2.9%** on ARC-AGI-2, with high-compute versions failing or timing out[4]. The competition (ARC Prize 2025) runs until November 3, 2025, with the Grand Prize requiring **85% accuracy** on the private evaluation set[5]. Current leaderboard scores are based on ~50% of test data, with final results pending[3].  

---

=== KEY FACTORS ===  
1. **Current AI Performance**: Top models (e.g., o3) score **<3%**, far below the 85% threshold[4].  
2. **Benchmark Difficulty**: ARC-AGI-2 requires fluid intelligence, resisting memorization and demanding novel reasoning[2][5].  
3. **Time Remaining**: ~6 months until November 3, allowing potential improvements.  
4. **Competition Structure**: Private evaluation set restrictions (e.g., no internet/API access) limit solutions to self-contained systems[5].  
5. **Human Baseline**: Average human score is **60%**, with all tasks solvable by humans in ≤2 attempts[4].

=== DETAILED ANALYSIS ===  
The gap between current AI performance and the 85% target is **massive**. While the competition allows time for optimization, ARC-AGI-2’s design explicitly challenges AI’s ability to generalize beyond training data[2]. High-compute models’ failures suggest brute-force approaches are ineffective, and the private evaluation set’s restrictions further limit potential solutions[5].  

However, the competition’s open nature on Kaggle may incentivize novel strategies. Teams could leverage hybrid approaches (e.g., combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks) or exploit patterns in the training data. Yet, given the benchmark’s focus on **fluid intelligence**—a capability AI systems currently lack—the likelihood of achieving 85% remains low.

=== PROBABILITY ESTIMATION ===  
**Estimated probability for 'YES' outcome: 0.05 (5%)**  
**Rationale**:  
- Current scores are **orders of magnitude below 85%**, with no evidence of breakthroughs in the search results[4].  
- The benchmark’s design prioritizes reasoning over memorization, a weakness for current AI systems[2][5].  
- While time remains, the complexity of ARC-AGI-2 tasks and restrictions on external resources (e.g., APIs) make rapid progress unlikely[5].  
- Market prices (23% YES) overestimate the probability given the technical barriers and current performance.
