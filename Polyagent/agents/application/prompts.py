        MARKET QUESTION: {question}
        DESCRIPTION: {description}
        CURRENT PRICES: {outcome}
        
        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        1. Focus on EDGE - identify discrepancies between market prices and true probabilities
        2. Consider TIME HORIZON - how long until market resolution
        3. Look for CATALYSTS - upcoming events that could impact outcome
        4. Evaluate MARKET SENTIMENT - are prices driven by emotion/bias?
        
        Analysis Framework:

        1. Market Context (2-3 sentences):
           - Core question/prediction
           - Time horizon
           - Key stakeholders

        2. Price Analysis (2-3 points):
           - Current market implied probabilities
           - Historical price context if relevant
           - Identify any pricing inefficiencies

        3. Key Factors (3-4 points):
           - Upcoming catalysts/events
           - Historical precedents
           - Structural considerations
           - Potential risks

        4. Edge Assessment:
           - Calculate expected value
           - Identify market mispricing if any
           - Confidence level (high/medium/low)

        Your response MUST follow this format:

        ANALYSIS:
        [Concise analysis following the framework above]

        CONCLUSION:
        I believe {question} has a likelihood of [EXACT_PROBABILITY] for outcome of [YES/NO].
        EDGE: [Describe specific edge vs market price]
        CONFIDENCE: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
        CATALYSTS: [Key upcoming events]

        RULES:
        - Probability MUST be between 0-1 (e.g., 0.75)
        - MUST identify specific edge vs market price
        - MUST provide concrete catalysts/timeline
        - NO hedging language ("maybe", "possibly", etc.)
        - BE DECISIVE - commit to a clear position
